    I participated in the 2nd session of the Multi-Stakeholder Working Group on Artificial Intelligence Regulation in Colombia, jointly organized by the Department of Telecommunications Law of the Externado University and the School of Government of the Universidad de Los Andes. We discussed the challenges asociated with the development and use of AI regarding Intelectual Property Rights.
