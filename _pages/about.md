 I am an economist and industrial engineer with a Master's in Economics from the [Universidad de los Andes](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/), Colombia. I have accrued over 10 years of experience in research, data science, analysis, and innovation, which have led me to develop a unique set of skills qualifying me to excel in research design, impact evaluation, empirical analysis, extracting meaningful insights, patterns, and trends from large and complex datasets while using this information to drive strategic decision-making.

 I have also honed my ability to communicate technical findings to non-technical stakeholders clearly and concisely, and I have led analytics initiatives with data teams in `crime` and `education`. Currently, I am an advisor to the Head of the Colombian Institute for the Evaluation of Education (ICFES) and serve as a professor of spatial analytics and as a teaching assistant of crime economics at Universidad de los Andes. 
 
 I am thrilled with research topics at the intersection of technology, machine learning, and public policy.
