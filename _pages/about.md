 I am an economist and industrial engineer with a Master's degree in Economics from the [Universidad de los Andes](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/), Colombia. I have accrued over 10 years of experience in research, data science, analysis, and innovation, which have led me to develop a unique set of skills qualifying me to excel in research design, impact evaluation, empirical analysis, extracting meaningful insights, patterns, and trends from large and complex datasets while using this information to drive strategic decision-making.

 I have also honed my ability to communicate technical findings to non-technical stakeholders clearly and concisely, and I have led analytics initiatives with data teams. Finally, I am thrilled with research topics at the intersection of techonolgy, machine leargning and public policy.
