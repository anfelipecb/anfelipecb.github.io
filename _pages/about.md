 I am an economist and industrial engineer with a Master's degree in Economics from the [Universidad de los Andes](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/). I have accrued over 10 years of experience in `research`, data science, analysis, and innovation, which have led me to develop a unique set of skills qualifying me to excel in empirical analysis, extract meaningful insights, patterns, and trends from large and complex datasets while using this information to drive strategic decision-making. Furthermore, my innovative approach to problem-solving has enabled me to identify opportunities for improvement and implement solutions with a measurable impact on driving efficiencies and fostering innovation with data-related products and high-quality research.

 I have also honed my ability to communicate technical findings to non-technical stakeholders clearly and concisely. Finally, I am thrilled with topics such as impact evaluation of public policies, education, spatial data science, innovation, crime economics, violence prevention, the Colombian criminal justice system, and decisions assisted by machine learning models.
