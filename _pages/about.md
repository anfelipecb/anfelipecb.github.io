*Machine learning for social good*

{: .justify-text}
I am a data scientist and researcher with a background in economics, industrial engineering, and computational public policy. Currently, I am pursuing an MS in Computational Analysis & Public Policy at the [University of Chicago](https://capp.uchicago.edu/), where I am further refining my expertise in machine learning, databases, and computational policy analysis. My work is driven by a commitment to advancing data-driven policy solutions that enhance social welfare and institutional efficiency.

My expertise lies at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and policy research, with a strong focus on crime, education, and economic development. Over the past decade, I have applied advanced quantitative methods, spatial analytics, and impact evaluation techniques to inform policy decisions and bridge policy with technological advancements and evidence-based innovation.

### Areas of Expertise
- **Quantitative Research & Data Science**: Expertise in statistical modeling, machine learning, and causal inference to analyze complex social and economic issues.
- **Spatial Analytics & Remote Sensing**: Application of GIS, remote sensing, and geospatial data analysis to study climate change impacts, urban development, inequality, and human capital.
- **Artificial Intelligence for Public Policy**: Development of predictive analytics and AI-driven solutions to enhance decision-making in law enforcement, education, and governance.
- **Scalable Data Pipelines & Infrastructure**: Proficient in Python, SQL, AWS, Google Cloud, and PySpark to build efficient data workflows for policy applications.
- **Teaching & Knowledge Dissemination**: Instructor of Spatial Analytics in Python & ArcGIS, committed to equipping professionals with practical data science skills. I was also TA for Econometrics and Impact Evaluation at [Universidad de los Andes](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/).
